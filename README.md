# Project Synopsis

Hypoxic events are increasing due to anthropogenic factors which has severe consequences for marine life. This objetive of this study is to see if hypoxia has physiological effects on the hairy shore crab (Hemigrapsus Oregonensis). Crabs were either exposed to a deepwater treatment containing water with no access to air, and an intertidal treatment containing both water and access to air via a mesh ladder. After one week, righting and resazurin experiments were performed. After two weeks, lactate, righting and resazuring experiments were performed, as well as a gill tissue diagnosis. It was determined that hypoxia does have an effect on the physiology of Hemigrapsus oregonensis. These results can be applied to other crab species and can help scientists and the commercial crab industry to predict the effects of hypoxia on certain crab populations.
